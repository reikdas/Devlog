> Managed to refactor over class SRComposite of TypeSystem.scala into root4j/refactor/ by replacing the row creating statements with storing the elements of Seq(or rather String in java) members into a List which is returned and added to the main array.

> Started refactoring over the streamer based classes of ast.scala into root4j/refactor/ (Solved the applyOrElse syntax refactoring issue with a try-catch block checking for a ArrayIndexOutofBoundsException).
