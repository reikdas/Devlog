> Managed to refactor SRMap from TypeSystem.scala to root4j/refactor/ by making the return type Map<SRType,SRType> of the functions. 

> Proper overriding of sub class from super class in refactored code of TypeSystem.scala being worked on.

> Replaced the regex match part in scala with searching the string className for aaa and bbb in java.
