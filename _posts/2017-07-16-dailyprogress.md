> Changed the implementation completely of case classes in TypeSystem.scala. Trying to find proper function return type for super class SRType.

> Finished translating the outline of all the relevant code from ast.scala and TypeSystem.scala. Started thinking of ways to link root4j and spark-root. 

> Waiting for queries to be answered to be able to start compiling root4j/refactor/
